# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Rede Peças — central API backend for a WhatsApp AI sales agent (auto parts marketplace in Angola) and its admin approval panel. The AI agent converses with customers over the Meta WhatsApp Cloud API, identifies their vehicle (VIN or guided steps), searches inventory, generates proforma PDFs, and walks them through payment; staff approve orders via the admin API (consumed by the separate `rede-pecas-admin` React repo at `D:\Invennico\rede-pecas-admin`).

See `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` for the current status against the SOW, known gaps, and the agreed next steps — read it before planning any feature work, and keep it updated when a gap listed there is closed. `TESTING.md` is the manual end-to-end test guide for the WhatsApp flow (there's no automated test runner — see below).

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # tsx watch, watches src/
npm run build      # tsc → dist/
npm start          # node dist/index.js (requires build)
npm run lint       # eslint src
npm run db:migrate # apply db/schema.sql to DATABASE_URL
npm run db:seed    # migrate + insert db/seed.sql sample data (safe to re-run — resets seed products to canonical qty/price)
npm run db:clear   # wipe DB data + flush Redis (db/clear.js) — always both together, see the file's header comment for why
npm run docs:flow  # regenerate the message-pipeline flow doc from scripts/flow-content.js
npm run admin:cli  # interactive terminal CLI to drive stock-confirmation/payment approval while testing WhatsApp locally (no admin panel UI needed) — see scripts/admin-cli.js
```

There are no automated tests yet (no test runner is configured). `TESTING.md` is the manual test matrix — run `npm run db:seed` first, then work through it against a running `npm run dev` instance. Note: the WhatsApp Business number is in Meta's sandbox mode, so it can only send to phone numbers explicitly added to the app's allowed-recipient list.

Boot requires a `.env` at the project root (copy `.env.example`) — `src/config/config.ts` throws at import time if any of these are missing: `DATABASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `WHATSAPP_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`, `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN`, `JWT_SECRET`. Redis (`REDIS_URL`) is optional — sessions fall back to an in-memory Map. Admin login needs at least one row in `admin_users` — `db/seed.sql` inserts a dev account (`admin@redepecas.ao` / `admin123`).

## Critical conventions

- **Language split**: code identifiers, DB tables/columns, stored status values, API routes, and JSON payload keys are **English**. **As of 2026-07-16, customer-facing conversation language is detected per customer**, not fixed globally: `detectGreetingLocale` (`src/utils/greeting.ts`) inspects a brand-new customer's very first message for an English or Portuguese greeting word (extended list — "Hi/Hello/Hey/Good morning/afternoon/evening/day" vs "Olá/Oi/Bom dia/Boa tarde/Boa noite/Tudo bem/Como está") and stamps the result once onto `customers.locale` (`getOrCreateCustomer`, `src/services/customer.service.ts`) — sticky for that customer from then on, never re-evaluated on later messages. A first message that isn't a recognizable greeting at all (e.g. straight to a VIN or a part name), or a pre-existing customer row whose `locale` is still NULL (created before this column existed), falls back to `DEFAULT_LOCALE` (`src/i18n/messages.ts`) — the environment's own configured `MESSAGE_LOCALE`, deliberately **not** a hardcoded language: hardcoding it to Portuguese caused legacy/undetected customers to get Portuguese while anything still on the fixed `t` (below) stayed on whatever `MESSAGE_LOCALE` actually was (`en` in this dev environment) — an inconsistent mix of both languages for the same customer. Every customer-facing WhatsApp send across the message pipeline (registration, vehicle ID, product search, payment/order flow) resolves `getMessages(customer.locale ?? DEFAULT_LOCALE)` (`src/i18n/messages.ts`) instead of a fixed message set — `resolveMessages(phone)` (`customer.service.ts`) is the shared helper for call sites that only have `phone` in scope. The old fixed `MESSAGE_LOCALE` env var / exported `t` constant still exists and still governs the paths that are deliberately **not** customer-locale-aware: the PDF proforma text (`pdf.service.ts`), admin-panel/admin-push messages (`adminAuth.service.ts`, and every `t.admin.*` call in `payment.service.ts`/`product.service.ts`), and the supplier delivery notice (`payment.service.ts`) — none of those are "the customer greeting the bot". Also note: the full-text search config is **not** `'portuguese'` (an earlier version of this note claimed it was) — `db/schema.sql`'s `search_vector` and `product.model.ts`'s `OR_TSQUERY` both build on `to_tsvector('english', ...)`/`to_tsquery('english', ...)` as of the 2026-07-14 English catalog-data switch, so Portuguese-specific stemming doesn't apply to either language's search terms today (lexeme/substring matching still works regardless). The two AI vision-extraction prompt bodies (`src/services/ai.service.ts`) are unrelated to any of this — they were already switched to English earlier (2026-07-10) for a different reason (Claude reasons more reliably in English on them), since the model never sees customer text at all.
- **ESM with NodeNext resolution**: `"type": "module"` + `moduleResolution: NodeNext`. All relative imports **must use the `.js` extension**, even inside `.ts` files (`import { config } from '../config/config.js'`). Omitting it breaks the build.
- Layering is `routes → controllers → services → models`, with raw `pg` queries in `src/models/` (no ORM) against a shared `Pool` from `src/config/db.ts`. Config is only read via the `config` object, never `process.env` directly.
- **Schema lives in `db/schema.sql`** (with `db/seed.sql` and `db/schema.dbml` for dbdiagram.io). SQL in models must match it — when you change one, change all three.
- **Every admin API response shares one envelope** — success: `{ success: true, message, code, data, [accessToken], [refreshToken], meta: { timestamp } }`; error: `{ success: false, message, code, data: null, meta: { timestamp } }`. No stack trace is ever sent to the client (logged server-side only via `logger.error`, in `errorHandler`). There's no shared response-builder function — each controller writes its own `res.status(code).json({...})` literally; only the shape is a convention, not a helper. The WhatsApp webhook endpoints are one exception (see below) — Meta's contract requires a bare 200 / raw challenge string, not this envelope. `/orders/:number/payment/proof` (see below) is a second, deliberate exception — it streams the raw image/PDF bytes with an `image/jpeg`/`application/pdf` Content-Type, since binary bytes can't usefully be wrapped in JSON.
- Errors: throw `ApiError` (from `src/utils/ApiError.ts`), wrap async route handlers in `catchAsync`; `errorConverter`/`errorHandler` in `src/middlewares/error.ts` produce the error envelope above. `validate(schema)` (`src/middlewares/validate.ts`) humanizes Joi's raw quoted-field messages (`"newPassword" is required` → `New Password is required`) before wrapping them in an `ApiError`. Admin routes validate input with Joi schemas in `src/validations/`.
- Logging goes through the Winston `logger` in `src/config/logger.ts`, not `console`.

## Architecture

Two route groups mounted under `/v1` (`src/routes/v1/index.ts`):

- `/v1/webhook/whatsapp` — Meta webhook. GET is the verification handshake; POST is the message intake, which **responds 200 immediately** (Meta's 5-second rule) and then processes asynchronously. Errors after that point are logged, never returned to Meta.
- `/v1/admin` — JWT-protected via `authMiddleware` (access-token payload: `{ id, email, role }`), individual accounts in `admin_users` (bcrypt password hashes, `adminAuth.service.ts`): `/login` (returns an access token, 1h default, + a refresh token, 30d default, stateless JWT with `type: 'refresh'` — `authMiddleware` rejects a refresh token used as a bearer token on any other route), `/refresh` (exchanges refreshToken for a new accessToken, no rotation/revocation), `/forgot/password` + `/reset/password` — identified by **phone**, not email (body: `{ phone }` / `{ phone, code, newPassword }`), since the 6-digit code is delivered over WhatsApp to that same number and there's no email/SMTP service in this project; `getAdminByPhone` compares digits-only so formatting in the stored `phone` column doesn't matter, `/profile` (GET/PATCH), `/change/password`; plus `/orders` list (`data.pending`/`data.approved`/`data.rejected`/`data.stockConfirmation`, pending first — pending/approved/rejected rows all carry `has_proof`/`payment_proof_media_type`), `/orders/:number/review` (body `{ approved: boolean }` — merges the old separate approve/reject endpoints), `/orders/:number/confirm/stock` (body `{ available: boolean }` — merges the old separate confirm/stock-unavailable endpoints), `/orders/:number/payment/proof` (GET, binary — streams the customer's uploaded payment-proof photo/PDF straight from Meta's Graph API via the existing `downloadWhatsAppMedia`, since the file itself is never stored on our infrastructure, only Meta's `payment_proof_media_id`), `/alerts` + `/alerts/:id/read` (the admin notification feed — see below), `/inventory/upload` + `/inventory/import` batch import. Route segments use `/` nesting, never hyphens. The admin panel (`rede-pecas-admin`) depends on these exact paths and payload keys (order fields `number, customer, part, reference, supplier, price, time, has_proof` — see the envelope convention above).

### Admin notifications: both an in-panel alert feed and WhatsApp pushes

`admin_alerts` (`src/models/alert.model.ts`) is a durable in-panel feed — `createAlert(type, orderNumber, message)` is called from `payment.service.ts` on payment-proof-received and in-person-payment-requested, and the admin panel polls `GET /v1/admin/alerts` (newest first, capped at 100) / `POST /v1/admin/alerts/:id/read` to dismiss. Alongside that, `payment.service.ts` also pushes a WhatsApp message to every row in `admin_users` (`getAllAdmins()`, not a single shared number — the old `config.admin.staffPhone`/`STAFF_PHONE_NUMBER` pattern was removed entirely) for the same events, plus the pre-existing stock-confirmation-needed push:
- **Stock confirmation needed** and **in-person payment requested** are plain text messages (`t.admin.stockConfirmationNeeded` / `t.admin.inPersonPaymentRequested`).
- **Payment proof received** is sent as an interactive message with the proof photo/PDF as the header (reusing the `media_id` Meta already issued for the inbound proof — no re-upload) and **Approve/Reject buttons attached directly** (`admin_approve_payment_<order>` / `admin_reject_payment_<order>`), handled by `processAdminPaymentReply` in `payment.service.ts` — the WhatsApp-native equivalent of the panel's `POST /orders/:number/review`, so either surface reaches the same outcome. Routed in `whatsapp.controller.ts`'s admin short-circuit by button-id prefix, alongside the stock-confirmation buttons (`processAdminStockReply`).
- None of these admin messages link to the panel anymore (`config.appUrl` was previously appended as `🔗 {url}/admin/orders`) — replaced with a plain "check the Rede Peças admin platform" line, since the buttons (where present) act directly from WhatsApp.

There is still no email notification — none exists in this codebase and none was added to scope.

### The message pipeline (the heart of the system)

`processMessageFlow` in `src/controllers/whatsapp.controller.ts` routes every incoming message through a strict priority chain — earlier stages short-circuit later ones.

Customer profile registration and vehicle identification are **independent state machines**, each with its own status, so whichever is missing is what the bot asks for next — a returning customer whose vehicle session simply expired is sent back into the vehicle-ID flow without re-doing their profile:
- **Profile**: `customers.registration_status` — `awaiting_name → awaiting_nif → awaiting_nif_number → awaiting_address → complete`. Covers name/NIF/address only.
- **Vehicle ID**: derived on every message from the `vehicles` table itself (no ORM/status field on `customers`) — `needsVehicleId` is true when the profile is `complete`, there's no in-progress manual-entry wizard, and `vehicleService.hasVehicleOnFile` finds no confirmed row. There is no separate "awaiting" status to keep in sync; the table's own shape (absent row / in-progress wizard step / confirmed row — see `vehicle.model.ts`) is the state.

**A customer can have multiple confirmed vehicles.** `vehicles.id` is the primary key (not `phone` — a customer can have several rows). `vehicleService.startAddVehicleFlow` re-runs the same VIN/photo/manual choice on demand (triggered by the "➕ Outro carro"/"➕ Add vehicle" button always offered alongside the ask-part prompt, or the same phrase typed free-text — `vehicleService.isAddVehicleRequest`), and `saveVehicleSession` always inserts a new row unless given a specific in-progress row's `id`, so existing vehicles are never touched by adding another. When a search is about to happen and the customer has 2+ vehicles, `sendAskPartPrompt` asks "which vehicle is this for?" first (`sessionService.savePendingVehicleChoice`/`getPendingVehicleChoice`) and `ai.service.ts` uses the resolved choice (`sessionService.getChosenVehicle`) instead of guessing.

Pipeline order:

1. Profile registration (new customer → guided name → NIF → address flow). Once `complete`, vehicle ID continues below via the normal stages instead of being re-intercepted here.
2. Explicit "add another vehicle" request (button or typed) — only once the customer already has at least one vehicle.
3. Vehicle-ID option button tap (VIN / photo / manual), shown whenever `needsVehicleId` is true, or the choice buttons were just shown (including via "add another vehicle" — `sessionService.wasVehicleIdChoiceShown`).
4. State-aware image routing: while vehicle ID is needed (missing, an active manual collection, or the choice buttons were just shown), an image is treated as a vehicle document (`processVehicleDocument`, via Claude Vision) instead of a payment proof.
5. Media (image/document) not caught by stage 4 → treated as payment proof (`processPaymentProof`)
6. Active manual vehicle collection (make → model → year → engine number step machine)
7. 17-char VIN detected → NHTSA decode → confirm buttons (falls back to manual collection, now with a message, on decode failure)
8. Vehicle confirmation reply (Sim/Não) — "Não" deletes only the just-rejected row (`vehicleService.getMostRecentVehicle` + `clearVehicleSession(id)`), never any other vehicle on file. If this is the customer's first-ever confirmed vehicle (`customers.registered_at` still `NULL`), stamps `registered_at` and sends the combined welcome message instead of the lighter "what part do you need" prompt
9. Pending "which vehicle is this for?" reply (2+ vehicles) — must resolve before the waitlist/confirmation checks below, which also interpret short numeric/yes-no replies
10. `needsVehicleId` still true and nothing above matched (e.g. non-VIN text with no VIN typed and no document sent) → starts manual collection deterministically rather than falling through to product search
11. Order awaiting payment input (`awaiting_payment_method` / `awaiting_*_subtype` states)
12. Part-search gate: free text is only ever treated as a product search once the customer has actually been asked "what part do you need" this session (`sessionService.wasPartPromptSent`) — otherwise (or on a bare greeting, PT/EN, matched via `GREETING_PATTERN` — this always wins even if already invited) the bot (re-)sends that deterministic prompt instead
13. Reply to a just-shown product search-results list (row tap or typed digit, `sessionService.getPendingOptions` + `productService.processProductSelection`) — not selection-shaped (e.g. a new part name typed instead) falls through to a fresh search below rather than a dead end
14. Explicit request to talk to a human — deterministic keyword match (`HUMAN_HANDOFF_PATTERN` in `whatsapp.controller.ts`), no AI judgment call
15. Fallback: deterministic product search (`productService.searchAndRespond`) — full-text match against the inventory DB, no AI involved

New message-handling behavior must slot into this chain deliberately — position determines what can intercept what.

### Conversational state

State is per-phone-number and lives in two places:

- **PostgreSQL** — durable step-machine state: `customers.registration_status`, `vehicles.status` (the merged per-customer vehicle-identification table — see below), and `orders.status` (state machine in `src/services/payment.service.ts`: `awaiting_payment → awaiting_payment_method → awaiting_bank_subtype | awaiting_in_person_subtype → awaiting_payment_proof | awaiting_agent_confirmation → payment_proof_received → approved | rejected`).
- **Redis** — pending search options awaiting the customer's list tap or typed digit (key `options:<phone>`), 4h TTL (`src/services/session.service.ts`), with silent in-memory fallback when Redis is down.

### No conversational AI (as of 2026-07-09)

There is no conversational AI agent anywhere in the WhatsApp flow. Product search (`productService.searchAndRespond`) is a deterministic full-text query against the inventory DB (`plainto_tsquery('portuguese', ...)`, already synonym/typo-tolerant) on the customer's raw message — no query cleanup, no intent parsing. Results are sent as a WhatsApp **List Message** (`whatsapp.service.ts` → `sendWhatsAppList`, up to 3 rows, cheapest first) rather than a numbered text message; the customer's reply (row tap or typed digit) is resolved deterministically by `productService.processProductSelection`, same style as the existing Sim/Não handlers elsewhere in the pipeline. "Talk to a human" is a plain keyword match (`HUMAN_HANDOFF_PATTERN`), not an AI inference.

The **only** AI calls anywhere in this codebase are two Claude Vision extraction calls, both in `src/services/ai.service.ts`, both on the `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` model:
- `extractDataWithClaudeVision` — vehicle document/VIN photo extraction, wired in via `processVehicleDocument`.
- `extractPaymentProofData` — payment-proof extraction, wired in via `processPaymentProof` in `payment.service.ts`. Runs on **both** photo and PDF proofs (as of 2026-07-13) — the call sends an `image` or `document` content block to Claude depending on `mediaType`, so neither media type bypasses validation. A proof that comes back `valid: false` (e.g. not actually a receipt, illegible, blank) sends a generic "couldn't confirm this is valid, please resend" message with a "Try again" button (`t.payment.proofInvalid`/`proofRetryButtons`) — same reason-not-leaked-to-customer pattern as `document.invalid()` below, Claude's actual `reason` is logged server-side only — and does **not** advance `orders.status` or create an admin alert; only a validated proof does both.

Neither call ever sees customer chat text — both take image/document input only, never text. There is no system prompt, no JSON action dispatch, and no Redis-held conversation history anymore (the old rolling 20-message `session:<phone>` key and `getHistory`/`saveHistory` were removed as dead weight along with the agent that used them).

### Intended end-to-end workflow (agreed with Vivek, 2026-07-02; registration/vehicle split reversed 2026-07-07)

The target customer journey is documented in full in `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` → "Full intended workflow". Of the three decisions from that discussion:

- **Onboarding was a single merged flow from 2026-07-02, split back into two independent state machines on 2026-07-07** (registration and vehicle ID have their own status again — see the message pipeline above): the merge made it impossible to resume "just the vehicle" for a returning customer whose vehicle session expired without also re-checking profile status, and complicated adding more independent-status entities (e.g. suppliers) the same way later.
- **Image routing is now state-aware** (implemented 2026-07-02): resolved as part of the same change, since it was a hard prerequisite for wiring in Vision. Still keyed off `needsVehicleId` after the 2026-07-07 split, just computed differently.
- **Staff/admin WhatsApp notification trigger moving to order creation** — still **not implemented as a trigger-point change**; the trigger still fires when a payment proof lands or presential payment is chosen. The delivery mechanism did change on 2026-07-1x: instead of pushing a WhatsApp message to the admin's own phone, it now writes to the `admin_alerts` feed (see above). No email notification — none exists in this codebase and none was added to scope.

Refund tracking on order rejection was explicitly decided *against* — it stays a message-only "refunded within 3–5 business days" notice with no new order status, consistent with payment gateway integration being out of scope per the SOW.
